comment: Q3: Write a program to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle given its length and breadth.

/*
Sample Test Cases:
Input 1:
5 10
Output 1:
Area=50, Perimeter=30

Input 2:
3 7
Output 2:
Area=21, Perimeter=20

*/
  #include <stdio.h>
int main () {
int length=10,breadth=5;

printf ("area is %d\n perimeter is %d" ,length*breadth,2*length+2*breadth);

return 0;
}
